### Purpose
This is a small project: in 2013, I wrote a program using PIL that generates
cards for playing [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28game%29), a
card game I enjoy. You can see the generated cards
[here](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/a.debray/cards/).

I wanted to play with the card design a little. Or maybe I needed an excuse
to try Pillow. Anyways, I'm planning to clean up the code, switch to
Pillow, and fiddle with the designs/colors/etc. until I'm happy.

### Current State
Right now, I've just started: I have my old PIL code from two years ago, and
I'm going to begin porting it to Pillow. I'll also clean up the code a little
bit, and hopefully fiddle with the design of the cards a little bit, too.

One specific goal I have is to make it easy to change the background color
(which could be useful to indicate a card was clicked).
